# Tehtävät 2.1 - 2.XX

## 2.1: Course information step6

Let's finish the code for rendering course contents from exercises 1.1 - 1.5. You can start with the code from the model answers. The model answers for part 1 can be found by going to the submission system, clicking on my submissions at the top, and in the row corresponding to part 1 under the solutions column clicking on show. To see the solution to the course info exercise, click on index.js under kurssitiedot ("kurssitiedot" means "course info").

Note that if you copy a project from one place to another, you might have to delete the node_modules directory and install the dependencies again with the command npm install before you can start the application.

Generally, it's not recommended that you copy a project's whole contents and/or add the node_modules directory to the version control system.

Let's change the App component like so:

```
const App = () => {
  const course = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Half Stack application development',
    parts: [
      {
        name: 'Fundamentals of React',
        exercises: 10,
        id: 1
      },
      {
        name: 'Using props to pass data',
        exercises: 7,
        id: 2
      },
      {
        name: 'State of a component',
        exercises: 14,
        id: 3
      }
    ]
  }

  return <Course course={course} />
}
```

export default Appcopy
Define a component responsible for formatting a single course called Course.

The component structure of the application can be, for example, the following:

App
Course
Header
Content
Part
Part
...

Hence, the Course component contains the components defined in the previous part, which are responsible for rendering the course name and its parts.

The rendered page can, for example, look as follows:

You don't need the sum of the exercises yet.

The application must work regardless of the number of parts a course has, so make sure the application works if you add or remove parts of a course.

Ensure that the console shows no errors!

## 2.2: Course information step7

Show also the sum of the exercises of the course.

sum of exercises added feature

## 2.3 Course information step8

If you haven't done so already, calculate the sum of exercises with the array method reduce.

Pro tip: when your code looks as follows:

const total =
parts.reduce((s, p) => someMagicHere)copy
and does not work, it's worth it to use console.log, which requires the arrow function to be written in its longer form:

const total = parts.reduce((s, p) => {
console.log('what is happening', s, p)
return someMagicHere
})

Not working? : Use your search engine to look up how reduce is used in an Object Array.

## 2.4: Course information step9

Let's extend our application to allow for an arbitrary number of courses:

```
const App = () => {
  const courses = [
    {
      name: 'Half Stack application development',
      id: 1,
      parts: [
        {
          name: 'Fundamentals of React',
          exercises: 10,
          id: 1
        },
        {
          name: 'Using props to pass data',
          exercises: 7,
          id: 2
        },
        {
          name: 'State of a component',
          exercises: 14,
          id: 3
        },
        {
          name: 'Redux',
          exercises: 11,
          id: 4
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: 'Node.js',
      id: 2,
      parts: [
        {
          name: 'Routing',
          exercises: 3,
          id: 1
        },
        {
          name: 'Middlewares',
          exercises: 7,
          id: 2
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      // ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

The application can, for example, look like this:

arbitrary number of courses feature add-on

## 2.5: separate module

Declare the Course component as a separate module, which is imported by the App component. You can include all subcomponents of the course in the same module.

# Exercises 2.6.-2.10.

In the first exercise, we will start working on an application that will be further developed in the later exercises. In related sets of exercises, it is sufficient to return the final version of your application. You may also make a separate commit after you have finished each part of the exercise set, but doing so is not required.

2.6: The Phonebook Step1
Let's create a simple phonebook. In this part, we will only be adding names to the phonebook.

Let us start by implementing the addition of a person to the phonebook.

You can use the code below as a starting point for the App component of your application:

```
import { useState } from 'react'

const App = () => {
const [persons, setPersons] = useState([
{ name: 'Arto Hellas' }
])
const [newName, setNewName] = useState('')

return (

<div>
<h2>Phonebook</h2>
<form>
<div>
name: <input />
</div>
<div>
<button type="submit">add</button>
</div>
</form>
<h2>Numbers</h2>
...
</div>
)
}
```

export default Appcopy
The newName state is meant for controlling the form input element.

Sometimes it can be useful to render state and other variables as text for debugging purposes. You can temporarily add the following element to the rendered component:

<div>debug: {newName}</div>copy
It's also important to put what we learned in the debugging React applications chapter of part one into good use. The React developer tools extension is incredibly useful for tracking changes that occur in the application's state.

After finishing this exercise your application should look something like this:

screenshot of 2.6 finished
Note the use of the React developer tools extension in the picture above!

NB:

you can use the person's name as a value of the key property
remember to prevent the default action of submitting HTML forms!

## 2.7: The Phonebook Step2

Prevent the user from being able to add names that already exist in the phonebook. JavaScript arrays have numerous suitable methods for accomplishing this task. Keep in mind how object equality works in Javascript.

Issue a warning with the alert command when such an action is attempted:
2.7 sample screenshot

Hint: when you are forming strings that contain values from variables, it is recommended to use a template string:

`${newName} is already added to phonebook`copy
If the newName variable holds the value Arto Hellas, the template string expression returns the string

`Arto Hellas is already added to phonebook`copy
The same could be done in a more Java-like fashion by using the plus operator:

newName + ' is already added to phonebook'copy
Using template strings is the more idiomatic option and the sign of a true JavaScript professional.

## 2.8: The Phonebook Step3

Expand your application by allowing users to add phone numbers to the phone book. You will need to add a second input element to the form (along with its own event handler):

```
<form>
  <div>name: <input /></div>
  <div>number: <input /></div>
  <div><button type="submit">add</button></div>
</form>
```

At this point, the application could look something like this. The image also displays the application's state with the help of React developer tools:

2.8 sample screenshot

## 2.9 \*: The Phonebook Step4

Implement a search field that can be used to filter the list of people by name:

## 2.9 sample screenshot

You can implement the search field as an input element that is placed outside the HTML form. The filtering logic shown in the image is case insensitive, meaning that the search term arto also returns results that contain Arto with an uppercase A.

NB: When you are working on new functionality, it's often useful to "hardcode" some dummy data into your application, e.g.

```
const App = () => {
  const [persons, setPersons] = useState([
    { name: 'Arto Hellas', number: '040-123456', id: 1 },
    { name: 'Ada Lovelace', number: '39-44-5323523', id: 2 },
    { name: 'Dan Abramov', number: '12-43-234345', id: 3 },
    { name: 'Mary Poppendieck', number: '39-23-6423122', id: 4 }
  ])

  // ...
}
```

This saves you from having to manually input data into your application for testing out your new functionality.

## 2.10: The Phonebook Step5

If you have implemented your application in a single component, refactor it by extracting suitable parts into new components. Maintain the application's state and all event handlers in the App root component.

It is sufficient to extract three components from the application. Good candidates for separate components are, for example, the search filter, the form for adding new people to the phonebook, a component that renders all people from the phonebook, and a component that renders a single person's details.

The application's root component could look similar to this after the refactoring. The refactored root component below only renders titles and lets the extracted components take care of the rest.

```
const App = () => {
// ...

return (
<div>
<h2>Phonebook</h2>

      <Filter ... />

      <h3>Add a new</h3>

      <PersonForm
        ...
      />

      <h3>Numbers</h3>

      <Persons ... />
    </div>

)
}
```

NB: You might run into problems in this exercise if you define your components "in the wrong place". Now would be a good time to rehearse the chapter do not define a component in another component from the last part.
